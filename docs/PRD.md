### 5. Layout Data Model

Business card layouts are stored as hierarchical JSON objects. Each component includes:

- **type:** Component type (`heading`, `text`, `link`, `image`, `column`, etc.)
- **content:** Text, URL, or media path (if applicable)
- **style:** CSS-like styling information; supports responsive variants
- **children:** Array of child components (for nesting)

#### Example JSON Structure
```json
{
  "type": "card",
  "id": "root",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "column",
      "id": "col-1",
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "heading",
          "id": "heading-1",
          "content": "John Doe",
          "style": { "fontSize": "24px", "fontWeight": "bold" }
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "id": "text-1",
          "content": "Software Engineer",
          "style": { "fontSize": "16px", "color": "#555" }
        },
        {
          "type": "link",
          "id": "link-1",
          "content": "www.johndoe.com",

          "style": { "color": "#007bff" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "column",
      "id": "col-2",
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "image",
          "id": "image-1",
          "content": "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
          "style": { "width": "80px", "height": "80px", "borderRadius": "50%" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
